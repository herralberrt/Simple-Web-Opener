# Simple Web Opener -> Powered by Romaniuc Albert-Iulian

# Description:
# This program allows users to quickly open websites by entering URLs directly in the terminal.
# It automatically adds "https://" if missing, validates the URLs, and stores them in a history file.
# Users can:
#   - Open multiple websites at once (comma or space separated)
#   - View their search history
#   - Open all previously searched websites
#   - Clear the search history
# The program is interactive and continuously accepts input until the user types "exit".
